# Mass shootings in the US

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as [an open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

## Obtain the data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

mass_shootings <- read_csv(here::here("data", "mass_shootings.csv"))

glimpse(mass_shootings)

## Explore the data

### Specific questions

-   Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year.

```{r}

yearly_shootings <- mass_shootings %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())
```

-   Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest and each bar should show its number.

```{r, echo -}

#first let's count race 
race_counts <- mass_shootings %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-count)

print(race_counts)
#let's then plot this information, by far the majority are White
ggplot(race_counts, aes(x = reorder(race, -count), y = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Number of Shooters", title = "Number of Mass Shooters by race") + 
  theme_minimal()


```

-   Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(mass_shootings, aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Type of Location", y = "Total Victims", title = "Total Victims by Type of Location") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#evidently there is a huge outlier which is the Las Vegas Strip massacre so let's just exclude that datapoint manually
no_outlier_shootings <- mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(total_victims <200)

ggplot(no_outlier_shootings, aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Type of Location", y = "Total Victims", title = "Total Victims by Type of Location") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### More open-ended questions

Address the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

-   How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?

```{r}

#let's filter the data to match the criteria and then count the number of rows

mental_illness_shootings <- mass_shootings %>%
  filter(prior_mental_illness == "Yes", year > 2000, race == "White", male == TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())

print(mental_illness_shootings)

```

-   Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological (natural) order (Jan-Feb-Mar- etc) to provide evidence of your answer.

```{r}
#first count the number of shootings each month chronogically
danger_month <- mass_shootings %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(count = n())

#probably there is a more elegant way to do it but I'm going to manually label each month's order and add a column to the dataframe then reorder
danger_month <- danger_month %>% 
  mutate(month_order = case_when(
    month =="Jan" ~"1",
    month =="Feb" ~"2",
    month =="Mar" ~"3",
    month =="Apr" ~"4",
    month =="May" ~"5",
    month =="Jun" ~"6", 
    month =="Jul" ~"7",
    month =="Aug" ~"8", 
    month =="Sep" ~"9", 
    month =="Oct" ~"10",
    month =="Nov" ~"11", 
    month =="Dec" ~"12",
    TRUE ~ ""
  ))
#new column is going to be a string so let's convert it to a number
danger_month <- danger_month %>%  
  mutate(month_order = as.numeric(month_order))

#now we can reorder it
danger_month <- danger_month %>% 
  arrange(month_order)
#check that the ordering is now correct --> yes it is. 
print(danger_month)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
#now we print ggplot, looks like February has the most, but not by much, especially this is over 30 years.
ggplot(danger_month, aes(x = reorder(month, month_order) , y = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Shootings", title = "Number of Shootings by Month") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

-   How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

```{r, echo=TRUE, cahce=FALSE}
str(mass_shootings)
#we'll just tell ggplot to fiter within ggpot
fatalities_white <- ggplot(mass_shootings[mass_shootings$race == "White",], aes(x = fatalities)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Fatalities per Shooting",
    y = "Fatality frequency",
    title = "Histogram of Fatalities by White"
    ) + 
  xlim(0,120)

fatalities_black <- ggplot(mass_shootings[mass_shootings$race == "Black",], aes(x = fatalities)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "white") + 
  labs(
    x = "Fatalities per Shooting",
    y = "Fatality frequency",
    title = "Histogram of Fatalities by Black"
    ) + 
  xlim(0,15)

print(fatalities_black)
print(fatalities_white)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
#let's look at the graphs, black people have far lower frequency, and lower fatalities per shooting
print(fatalities_white)
print(fatalities_black)

```

### Very open-ended

-   Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter?

```{r}
#remind ourselves how the database is organised
str(mass_shootings)

#OK I'm just going to look at quantitative data and practice overlaying histograms at the same time. 

#let's try create an overlay of distributions along a few variables. First let's save the filtered df's with mental illness vs no mental illness

mentally_ill_shooters <- mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(prior_mental_illness == "Yes")


mentally_healthy_shooters <- mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(prior_mental_illness == "No")
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
#let's first see how fatalities differ: there are fewer "healthy" shooters and there are fewer shootings which have double digit fatalities
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_ill_shooters, aes(x = fatalities), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_healthy_shooters, aes(x = fatalities), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Fatalities per shootings",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Overlay of fatality histograms"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 120)

#let's look at injured next: again fewer injuries and fewer high double digit injuries so in general we can generalise that mentally ill shootings are more common and more deadly
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_ill_shooters, aes(x = injured), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_healthy_shooters, aes(x = injured), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Injuries per shooting",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Overlay of injury histograms"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 120)

#finally let's look at the age --> no obvious differences
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_ill_shooters, aes(x = age_of_shooter), fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  geom_histogram(data = mentally_healthy_shooters, aes(x = age_of_shooter), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Age",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Overlay of injury histograms"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 120)

```

-   Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

```{r}
#we're just going to visually inspect this: visually, we can see there are more shootings (dots) with prior mentally ill shooters,
#we can see there are more shootings with high number of victims
#we can see thre are relatively more shootings in the "other" location types for non-ill shooters, suggesting more predictability by place
# we can see religious airport and military settings are relatively uncommon, we can see that school shootings are more dangerous on average than workplace settings
# we can see that non-mentally ill shooters are relatively more concentrated in schools than in other location types (apart from "other") 
ggplot(mass_shootings, aes(x = total_victims, y = location_type, color = prior_mental_illness)) + 
  geom_point(data = na.omit(mass_shootings)) + 
  labs(
    x = "total victims",
    y = "prior mental illness",
    title = "total victims, mental illness and location type"
  ) +
  xlim(0,120)

```
