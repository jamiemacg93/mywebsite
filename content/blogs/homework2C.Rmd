# Exploring sources of electricity production, CO2 emissions, and GDP per capita.

There are many sources of data on how countries generate their electricity and their CO2 emissions. 

We will get energy data from the Our World in Data website, and CO2 and GDP per capita emissions from the World Bank, using the `wbstats`package.

```{r}
#############Question 2################

#playing around with formatting to see what we can map in a 2d space, e.g. it seems like the relationship between GDP per capita and co2 is getting weaker over time
#i.e. hotter colours show a steeper slope than colder colours. the triangles and circles are probably overkill

  geom_point(size = 0.5, aes(shape = ifelse(GDPpercap > 50000, "circle", "triangle")))+
  labs(x ="GDP per capita",
       y = "CO2 per capita",
       title = "CO2 vs GDP (per capita)",
       shape = "GDP high (circle) vs low (triangle)")+
